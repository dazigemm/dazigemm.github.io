<h3> Launched: </h3>
<a href = "https://github.com/rosyang/Battlefield"> Battlefield </a>: 
Project a friend and I coded in Java, junior year of high school. Implemented data structures to recreate the game of battleship. Meant to be played in the terminal, with the option to go up against the computer, or another human player.
<br>
<h3> In Progress: </h3>
