			<h1> Hello World! </h1>
			Night owl with a sweet tooth here.
			<br>
			I'm Daisy Zheng, a rising junior studying Computer Science at New York University, and minoring in Bioinformatics.
			<br>
			In the future, I hope to to utilize computer science to sort help scientists sort through the data they gather from research, furthering the understanding of diseases, and hopefully enabling more people to lead happier and healthier lives.
			<br>
			I still have a lot to learn, but in the meantime check out some of the projects I have worked on recently <a href="#projects">below.</a>			<br>
			If you also want to chat, then <a href="#contact">let's get in touch!</a>
			<br>
			I'm always open to gaining more experience, working on new projects or just grabbing a sweet treat.
			<br>
			Thanks for stopping by!
