Hello, world! 
<br>
Nocturnal creature here. Welcome to my site. It's still being set up, please excuse its blandness. In the meantime, check out my projects <a href = "#projects"> below</a>. 
<br>
</div>
<div id = "projects"> <h2> Project(ile)s </h2>
<h3> Launched: </h3>
<a href = "https://github.com/rosyang/Battlefield"> Battlefield </a>: 
Project a friend and I coded in Java, junior year of high school. Implemented data structures to recreate the game of battleship. Meant to be played in the terminal, with the option to go up against the computer, or another human player.
<br>
<h3> In Progress: </h3>
This website, excuse the mess. Planning to build entirely from scratch. Check out the code so far
