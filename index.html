			<h1> Hello World! </h1>
			Night owl with a sweet tooth here.
			<br>
			Welcome to my site.
			<br>
			I'm Daisy Zheng, a current junior at New York University studying Computer Science.
			<br>
			I still have a lot to learn, but what better way to learn than through hands-on-experience?
			<br>
			I'm always open to gaining more experience, working on new projects or just grabbing a sweet treat.
			<br>
			If any of the above sound interesting to you, then <a href="#contact">let's get in touch!</a>
			<br>
			In the meantime check out some of the projects I have worked on recently <a href="#projects">below.</a>
			<br>
			Thanks for stopping by and hope you have a wonderful day/night!
